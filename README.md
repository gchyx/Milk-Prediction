# Predicting Milk Quality with Decision Trees

## Description
This Python script utilizes a decision tree algorithm to predict the quality of milk based on various features including pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat content, Turbidity, and Color. The quality of milk is categorized into three levels: low (bad), medium (moderate), and high (good).

## Features
- pH
- Temperature
- Taste
- Odor
- Fat content
- Turbidity
- Color

## Accuracy
The model achieved an impressive accuracy ranging from 0.9968 to 1.0, indicating its effectiveness in predicting milk quality based on the provided features.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that the necessary Python libraries such as scikit-learn are installed.
2. Run the Python script 'milk.py'.
3. Input the values for the features (pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat content, Turbidity, Color) when prompted.
4. The script will then predict the quality of the milk based on the provided features.

## Note
- The accuracy of the predictions may vary based on the dataset used and the specific conditions under which the model was trained.
- This script serves as a demonstration of using decision trees for milk quality prediction and can be further modified or extended for specific use cases or datasets.
